# Megaman-Battle-Frame

This is a megaman fan game that I made for fun. It is a two player game in which you choose a character from megaman, choose a stage from Megaman, and fight each other. I made this using GameMaker Studio 2, and have the gms file, as well as an executable. Both players play using one keyboard. I have stopped working on this project for some time, but I may come back to it to fix things, add more characters, and make the game better in general later on.

## Instructions

- Import the gms file into GameMaker Studio 2
- Or Run the .exe file

## Prerequisites
- A computer that uses Windows (For .exe file)
- Gamemaker Studio 2 (for gms file)

### General Game Mechanics

- You run jump and shoot people
- Shooting uses ammo which regens over time, if you don't shoot for a little bit
- Different characters have different shots, and some of them can charge up their shots. Charged shots can be charged up mid way and full way, usually producing different attacks as a result.
- Some characters have a slide which can be used by pressing down
- Different stages have different hazards
- Falling to the bottem of the stage will kill you
- Random items will drop at random times throughout the stage
